# Real-Time Chat Frontend

This project is a real-time chat application frontend built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and utilizes [SignalR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/signalr) for real-time communication. It was initialized with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To start the development server, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the chat application.

### Development
You can modify the project by editing the `app/page.tsx` file. Any changes made will automatically update in the browser.

This project leverages [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for optimized font loading, specifically the Inter font.

## Real-Time Communication with SignalR

This frontend connects to a SignalR backend to enable real-time chat functionality. Ensure that the backend server is running and properly configured to handle WebSocket connections.
